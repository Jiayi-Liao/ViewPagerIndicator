#ViewPagerIndicator

It'a demo of my ViewPagerIndicator.

Four classes:
1. MainActivity
2. MyViewPagerAdapter
3. IndicatorAdapter
4. IndicatorView

It's just a simple demo to make texts slide when pages are scrolled.
You can make it better by redefining the attrs.xml file to give it more attributes.

==The demo is very easy for everyone , wish you will like it !==
